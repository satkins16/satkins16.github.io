The world of coding is vast. That's something I noticed day one. But I never truly felt the impact of it until I dove in. I spent weeks learning the ins and outs of Ruby. It was tough but rewarding (as I'm seeing that all of this is), and I felt I had accomplished something when I completed the Intro to Ruby course. Congratulations. On to HTML/CSS.

Right when I was feeling confident about my ability in this one specific language, it was time to move on to the next. So this got me thinking. What kind of developer do I want to be? Do I want to be a jack of all trades who is proficient at every language out there? Or do I want to be a master of one? Is it possible to be a master of them all? Probably not, but maybe I'll try! My point is that I'm curious what the landscape of developers look like regarding mastery of various languages, and I hope to learn the answer soon. But more importantly, I hope to discover what kind of developer I want to be.
