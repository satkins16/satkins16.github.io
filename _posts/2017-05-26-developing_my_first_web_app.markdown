***"Don't be the guy that always asks, 'What if?' Build Something." - Silicon Valley***

I did it! I created an app! Wow, what a feeling. Everybody has an app idea nowadays. What everyone doesn't have, is the knowledge and drive to actually follow through with that idea and create something. So finishing my Sinatra Portfolio Project and completing a genuine web app feels like a major accomplishment, regardless of the idea itself. Whether anyone ever sees this app, let alone anyone ever using it, is beside the point. I've built something.

While I faced a few tough errors that took me some time to correct, overall, things went smoothly. The concept for the app came from going through dozens and dozens of wedding gifts with my wife while my mother scribbled on a piece of scrap paper. She was writing down the name of each gift, and the name of the person(s) who gave the gift. Then my wife transfered that list to a poorly laid out excel file. She then used that file over the course of the next month as a checklist for thank you notes. I thought to myself, "There's got to be a simpler way to do this."

This app allows you to quickly and simply create an event, fill that event with gifts (to which have gift givers attached), and view a checklist for thank you notes. You can create, edit, and delete events, gifts, and gift givers. You can also view a list of all gift givers that have ever been entered into the database so if you ever need an idea for a gift to get someone else, you can see the entire history of what that person has gotten you in the past.

Everything functions perfectly and it feels like something people will definitely want to use.

But again, that's not the point. I feel accomplished just by building something.
