I think I've met my programming soulmate. And its name is Ruby. Ruby is beautiful, smart, and incredibly easy to talk to. It listens to my every request, and assists me at every step, helping me accomplish my goals. The problem is that Ruby is all I know. I came into this world with Ruby and I couldn't be more comfortable with it, but there are so many other languages out there and I know I'll be doing myself a disservice if I don't meet and experience each and every one of them. Who knows, maybe I'll fall in love all over again!

In all seriousness, Ruby is simply a pleasure to work with. I can't imagine another language matching it on ease of use and the way the programming syntax mirrors real-life human language. First of all, Object-Oriented Programming seems to be the way to go. It mirrors the way we think of the real world that surrounds us every day, in that objects are simply a collection of data and behaviors. Every object in life has data ascribed to it. A green ball has a color = 'green". A man named Steve has a name = "Steve". When Steve walks, methods are running through his head that tell him how and when to do so. And Steve ultimately has a concept of self. So do our objects in Ruby, beautifully and simply represented by what else but the *self* keyword. Nice and easy. Creator Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto summed up his desire to create a language that mirrored how humans think about the world when he said,

*"Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, 'By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something.' They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves."*

Wonderful. Thank you Matz.

But again, the caveat to all of this love is that I have yet to move on to Javascript, SQL, Python, etc... Maybe one of these will touch my heart in a different way than Ruby has. Maybe I'll love all of them the same. Maybe all of this affection for Ruby comes simply from the fact that it is my first experience with a programming language at all. I won't know until I get there. But for now, what I do know is this... I love Ruby.
