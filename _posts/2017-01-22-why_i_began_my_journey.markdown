I am a 29-year-old new father who had an established career in the television industry. In some ways I loved my job. I love television and entertainment in general, but something was missing. I didn't feel challenged. Before I began this new phase of my life, I had forgotten what it felt like to truly use all of my brain power to attempt to solve a problem. After being lightly exposed to the world of coding through some family and friends and reading up on The Flatiron School, I was intrigued to say the least. Working with computers and solving problems in general has always felt second-nature to me, and although changing careers at a time in my life when having a steady income was and is very important to me and my family is quite scary, I believed so strongly that this was the right place for me that I charged ahead full-steam.

The flexibility of the Flatiron School's online program was the final piece of the puzzle. As I said, the idea of having to quit my job before having a new one locked up was something I was not prepared to do with a small child at home. So learning that I could keep my full-time position and work at my own pace, more than assuaged my concerns. I'm still early in my journey, but I already feel that I might have found my calling. The level of difficulty and complexity in the teachings is only matched by how rewarded I feel when I solve a problem. It's exactly what I was looking for and exactly what I was missing.
