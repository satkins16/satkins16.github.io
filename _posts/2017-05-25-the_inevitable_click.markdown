title:  The Inevitable "Click"

Something has been stuck in my head since the beginning of this course. I remember reading that, while this was going to be one of the toughest endeavors of my life, there would inevitably be a day that everything "clicked". This was a popular sentiment with professionals that I've spoken to as well. Well, I think that I've finally reached my "click".

Learning to code is still incredibly difficult. I would never say that *everything* has clicked. But things seem to going more smoothly lately. Labs don't take as long. I understand new concepts more easily. And in turn, I'm having even more fun than I already was earlier on in the course. I can only imagine showing my 4-months-ago-self the work that I've done on my Sinatra Portfolio Project. Sinatra, Active Record, Tux, Rake, SQL, the relationship between databases and ruby objects. These are not simple programs and concepts. But they make sense to me. I'm starting to feel more like a coder. And that feels good.
