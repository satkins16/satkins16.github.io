While CSS can be the difference between a stale looking, bare-bones program and a vibrant, exciting webpage, it still has some rather archaic restrictions relative to other programming languages. In the case of adding a jQuery front-end to my Gift Organizer Rails app, there was nothing more restricting than a lack of If Statements in CSS.

There are multiple ways to get around this, but after lots of trail and error, I found what I felt to be the best way: switching classes through jQuery.
