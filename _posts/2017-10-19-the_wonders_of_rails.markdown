Whether others would agree or not I can't say, but it sure feels to me like I just completed the most vital section of the current curriculum. We've gone from learning base Ruby to base HTML, to SQL, ActiveRecord, and Sinatra, but none of these subjects were as all encompasing as the Rails framework.

I'm very happy with my Rails project. It feels concise, self-explanatory, and of course DRY. But honestly, it's almost difficult to make a project any other way using this framework. From the current_user method to all of my wonderful routes, that I must have used "rake routes" to see hundreds of times, everything was as simple as could be.

Having said that, I am thankful to the Flatiron School's learning style. We could easily just jump into Rails, ActiveRecord, Devise, and other frameworks that do most of the work for you (and I'm sure that's what many other schools do), but instead we learned the intense innerworkings of what these frameworks accomplish first so that not only can we manually do the work if necessary, but in the case that any of these frameworks break down or need debugging, we understand what's happening under the hood.

It's interesting, when you think about it, that basically all user account driven web apps boil down to CRUD. At all times you're either creating, reading, updating, or deleting something. It's up to our imagination to figure out what that thing is. As difficult as this journey has been, I'm truly starting to feel like things are clicking as the nuts and bolts of coding helps me see the bigger picture of coding. I think I feel as confident as I can feel in my database/back-end skills and am looking forward to adding some flare on the front-end! Bring on Javascript!
