<p>I am a 29-year-old new father who has an established career in the television industry. In some ways I love my job. I love television and entertainment in general, but something is missing. I don't feel challenged. Before I began this new phase of my life, I had forgotten what it felt like to truly use all of my brain power to attempt to solve a problem. After being lightly exposed to the world of coding through some family and friends and reading up on The Flatiron School, I felt I had found my calling. Working with computers and solving problems in general have always felt second-nature to me, and although changing careers at a time in my life when having a steady income is very important to me and my family is quite scary, I believe so strongly that this is right for me that I am wholeheartedly charging ahead into this endeavor with a renewed vigor. This blog is the story of my coding journey.</p>
